üìñ Backstory

Welcome to Brew Memory caf√© --- You've applied to become the next barista, but there's a catch our caf√© only hires those who can brew from memory.

To prove yourself, your challenge is to complete four levels of the caf√©'s top signature drinks. Each level tests your memory, speed and focus under pressure. But there's an extra twist some recipes will show up with missing ingredients, you'll have to guess what belongs in the brew.

Choose the right ingredients, be precise with your choices and prove you've got what it takes to earn the job. But be careful one wrong ingredient and you'll lose a life. Run out of time, and the manager won't be impressed. Can you survive and rise to the rank of master barista ?
